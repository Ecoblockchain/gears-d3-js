# gears.d3.js #

_Gears.d3.js_ is a [d3.js](http://d3js.org/) example for creating simulated gear animations with SVG.

Here you can see a [demo](https://codepen.io/liabru/pen/Edinj)

## Usage ##

See the included `index.html` for example usage, or see the [demo](https://codepen.io/liabru/pen/Edinj)

## Notes ##

It's based on this more limited [example](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1353700) by mbostock.
I improved it by adding a (basic) simulation of the gears, where power is actually trasmitted. 
The gears also can be dragged around and will automatically mesh correctly when they get close.

Note that the Fractal Gears implementation (as is on my site) is _not_ open source, other than the parts that are in this repo.
